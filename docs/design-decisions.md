# Design Decisions & Architecture Documentation

## Core Architecture

I chose to organize our code by business features instead of technical layers. This means each feature has its own UI parts, business logic, and data handling all in one place. This makes the code easier to maintain, keeps features separate, and lets multiple developers work at the same time.

## State Management Strategy

I picked the BLoC pattern to manage app state because it keeps UI and business logic separate and makes testing easier. I can also track how the state changes over time.

For live price updates, I built a system using streams with a special `TickMixin`. It uses WebSocket connections that can handle network problems. The system lets many widgets get symbol updates through one connection.

## Extensibility Framework

I used the Repository pattern to handle data flexibly. This means I can change data sources easily and test everything using mock data.

I made a single WebSocket handler to broadcast real-time data. I also added standard themes and reusable parts like `TickerMixin` to keep everything consistent across the app.

## Future-Proofing Measures

I added environment configuration through .env files, making it easy to switch between development and production setups. The API layer is designed so we can easily change endpoints when needed.

## Performance Optimization

I focused on:
- Managing memory well for WebSocket subscriptions
- Loading market data only when needed
- Making lists display efficiently when handling lots of data

## Enhancements

Future improvements can include:
- More comprehensive testing
- Setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Better app configuration management
- Adding analytics and monitoring
- Improving user experience with language options and notifications

These changes can help keep the app running well while adding new features.
